#The math equation for the prediction is:
# 0.2956+0.5062*Graduated.high.school.type -0.251*Regular.artistic.or.sports.activity +
# 0.12*Mothers.education + 0.1*Fathers.education + 0.5*Cumulative.grade.point.average.in.the.last.semester
#For each unit increase in the variable "Graduated high school type",and the rest remain constant, the predicted output grade increases by 0.5062 points. 
#However, this coefficient is not statistically significant at the conventional levels (p-value = 0.127), 
#meaning it might not have a significant impact on the output grade.
#For each unit increase in the variable "Regular artistic or sports activity", the predicted output grade decreases by 0.2513 points. 
#However, this coefficient is also not statistically significant (p-value = 0.484).
#For each unit increase in the variables "Mothers education" and "Fathers education", the predicted output grade increases by 0.1286 and 0.1325 points, respectively. 
#However, neither of these coefficients is statistically significant (p-values = 0.421 and 0.435).
#For each unit increase in the variable "Cumulative grade point average in the last semester", the predicted output grade increases by 0.5464 points. 
#This coefficient is statistically significant (p-value < 0.001), indicating a strong positive impact of the cumulative GPA on the output grade.

#The multiple R-squared value (0.1277) indicates that approximately 12.77% of the variance in the output grade is explained by the predictors in the model.
#The p-value associated with the F-statistic (p-value < 0.001) suggests that the overall 
#model is statistically significant, meaning at least one of the predictors has a significant effect on the output grade.

# Summary of the linear regression model
summary(linear_model2)

#Intercept (Constant): The intercept term (15.5228) represents the expected value of the outcome variable when 
#all predictor variables are zero.

#Sex (Male): Being male is significant (p-value < 0.001), with a coefficient of 1.5994. On average, 
#males have a higher outcome value compared to females.

#Additional Work: Having additional work experience is significant (p-value = 0.003), with a coefficient of -13.7933. 
#This suggests that students with additional work experience tend to have lower outcomes.

#Weekly Study Hours: Weekly study hours, while not statistically significant (p-value = 0.153), have a coefficient of -0.2784. This suggests a negative relationship, although it's not strong enough to be considered significant at conventional levels.

#Transportation to the University: The type of transportation to the university is significant (p-value = 0.009), 
#with a coefficient of -0.4065. Certain transportation methods are associated with lower outcomes.

#Accommodation Type in Cyprus: Accommodation type is not statistically significant (p-value = 0.116), 
#indicating that it might not have a significant impact on the outcome in this model.

#Preparation to Midterm Exams, Reading Frequency, Listening in Classes, Taking Notes in Classes: These variables, 
#either individually or in interaction with others, are significant predictors, indicating that students' study habits and preparation methods are related to the outcome variable.

#Cumulative Grade Point Average in the Last Semester: Cumulative GPA in the last semester is significant (p-value = 0.004) 
#with a coefficient of 0.3744. Higher GPA is associated with higher outcomes.

#The overall model (Multiple R-squared: 0.4397) explains approximately 44% of the variance in the outcome variable. 
#The adjusted R-squared accounts for the number of predictors in the model, providing a more accurate measure of 
#the model's goodness-of-fit when considering the number of predictors. 
#The F-statistic tests the overall significance of the model and indicates 
#that the model is statistically significant (p-value < 0.001).
